## TfL Congestion Charge Page

This webpage is a remake of: https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/congestion-charge-zone

Live version: https://tfl-app.herokuapp.com/

This project was created using Node for both, the front-end and the back-end. The main objective of this project was to show I could create an existing web page from scratch as well as integrate multiple API's as well as login authentication.

Users can interact with the site similarly to the original. All buttons and links connect to the same websites as the original, there is a post code search and a map with a search bar.

I replicated everything from scratch, omitting logos. For the styling, I used css from dev tools, whilst I used most of my own HTML.

For the Google Maps API, I used a combination of docs and tutorials, whereas for the ideal postcodes API, I used solely documentation.

For the Google login authentication, I also used the docs. Users are able to login with their Google account details, access the dashboard & the protected route that they could not access unless they are logged in, and also sign out.

## Future improvements

In future, I will incorporate user login authentication separate from Google's, using a database, so that users can register to this site, instead of linking to the TfL page.
