## TfL Congestion Charge Page

This webpage is a remake of: https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/congestion-charge-zone

The main objective of this project was to show I could create an existing web page, from scratch, and also integrate multiple API's.

User's can interact with the site similarly to the original. All buttons and links connect to the same websites as the original, there is a post code search and a map with a search bar.

I replicated everything from scratch, omitting logos. For the styling, I used css from dev tools, whilst I used most of my own HTML.

For the Google Maps API, I used a combination of docs and tutorials, whereas for the ideal postcodes API, I used solely documentation.

## Future improvements

In future, I will incorporate user login authentication, likely via Google, instead of linking to the TfL log in page.
